# Problem Report: Need More Information

The current problem statement "fix the code" is too vague to proceed with any specific fixes. To properly address code issues, please provide more details about:

1. What specific problems or bugs are being experienced?
2. What is the expected behavior vs current behavior?
3. Are there any error messages or stack traces?
4. Which specific functionality or features are affected?

The codebase appears to be a Spring Boot CRUD application with:
- User entity management
- REST controller
- JPA repository
- Service layer
- Basic tests

Without more specific information about what needs to be fixed, we cannot make informed changes to the code that might inadvertently introduce new issues or break existing functionality.

Please provide additional context about the problems that need to be addressed.
